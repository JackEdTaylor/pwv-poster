## Picture-Word Stimuli

![](img/stimuli_illustration.svg){fig-align="center"}

Picture-Word stimuli comprised pictures from the BOSS norms, and matched pairs of congruent and incongruent words, with predictability varied continuously.

A total of 400 words were selected with the R package, LexOPS ([Taylor et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01389-1)). There were 200 words per Congruency condition, with one congruent and one incongruent word per image. Images were taken from the Bank of Online Standardised Stimuli (BOSS) Norms ([Brodeur et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106953)). Congruent words were images' modal names; Incongruent words were matched item-wise to each Congruent word.

<br>

Words were selected...

1.  to have high word prevalence ([Brysbaert et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1077-9)) such that ≥90% of people knew each word.

2.  to be nouns, according to dominant part of speech in SUBTLEX-UK ([van Heuven et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.850521)).

3.  to have a mean concreteness rating \>4 (on a 1-5 scale; [Brysbaert et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5))

<br>

Picture-Congruent and -Incongruent words were matched on:

1.  Word length (number of characters), exactly.

2.  Concreteness according to [Brysbaert et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5), within ±.25

3.  Zipf frequency (a logarithmic scale of word frequency) according to SUBTLEX-UK ([van Heuven et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.850521)), within ±.125

4.  Character bigram probability (calculated from SUBTLEX-UK), within ±.0025

5.  OLD20 (the average Orthographic Levenshtein Distance of the 20 closest neighbours to a given word; [Yarkoni et al., 2008](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.3758/PBR.15.5.971)) calculated from the LexOPS inbuilt dataset, within ±.75.

<br>

Matched pairs of Picture-Congruent and -Incongruent words also had:

1.  Maximal distance from one another in orthographic Levenshtein distance.

2.  A cosine PPMI semantic similarity value of ≤.01 according to the Small World of Words ([De Deyne et al., 2019](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.3758/s13428-018-1115-7))

<br>

Each participant saw *Set 1* or *Set 2* of the stimuli, which determined which images preceded congruent, and which incongruent, words. These counterbalanced sets of stimuli were matched via overlap ([Pastore & Calcagnì, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01089)), to maximise distributional similarity in:

1.  Percentage of modal name agreement according to the BOSS norms

2.  Cosine PPMI semantic similarity according to the SWOW

3.  Zipf word frequency according to SUBTLEX-UK

4.  Character bigram probability according to SUBTLEX-UK

5.  Word concreteness ([Brysbaert et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5))

6.  Word length

7.  OLD20 (Orthographic neighbourhood density)

## Localiser Stimuli

![](img/example_localiser_images.png){fig-align="center"}

Localiser stimuli comprised matched triplets of words (Courier New font), false-font strings (BACS2serif font; [Vidal et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0844-8)), and phase-shuffled words. The pre-registered comparison was between words and false-font strings; phase-shuffled words were included as an exploratory comparison.

Distributional similarity of the words to various variables was maximised via distributional overlap ([Pastore & Calcagnì, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01089)), as shown below.

Phase-shuffled words were generated by randomly permuting the phase distribution of images of words. A GitHub repository implementing this method is available here: <https://github.com/JackEdTaylor/randphase>

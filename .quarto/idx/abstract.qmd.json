Prediction error captures two key variables: *magnitude* and *certainty* of the ascending-descending difference. Greater violations of expectations should elicit greater prediction error signals, and this effect should become larger as certainty increases. We asked whether such a simple predictive coding account could describe neural activity indexed by the N1 (\\~170 ms) event-related potential component elicited by words. Indeed, findings have shown that the word-related N1 is sensitive to predictions, with unpredicted words generally eliciting greater-amplitude N1s than predicted words. However, effects of error magnitude and certainty have mostly been investigated in isolation, providing incomplete tests of predictive coding. In our pre-registered study, we tested the account via the interaction between prediction congruency (error magnitude) and predictability (certainty). We recorded electroencephalograms for 68 participants while they completed a picture-word verification paradigm. PICTURE-*word* pairs were congruent (e.g., ONION-*onion*) or incongruent (e.g., ONION-*torch*), while predictability was manipulated continuously based on norms of picture-name association (% name agreement). Pre-registered analyses failed to find evidence that the direction of the congruency-predictability interaction matched that expected under a simple predictive coding account. Exploratory Bayesian analyses found strong evidence *against* the account, with the congruency-predictability interaction 51.52\\* times more likely in the opposite direction. Specifically, higher predictability elicited *larger* N1s for *picture-congruent* words, and *smaller* N1s for *picture-incongruent* words. We argue that a simple predictive coding account of the N1 is either incorrect or requires elaboration.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n\nAfter we refit the model using a random seed for reproducibility, this estimate changed to 59.98\n:::\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":false,"output-file":"abstract.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"visual","theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme-light.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Arial","title":"Abstract"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

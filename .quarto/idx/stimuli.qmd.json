There were 200 words per Congruency condition, with one congruent and one incongruent word per image. Images were taken from the Bank of Online Standardised Stimuli (BOSS) Norms ([Brodeur et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0106953)). Congruent words were images' modal names; Incongruent words were matched item-wise to each Congruent word.\n\n<br>\n\nWords were selected...\n\n1. to have high word prevalence ([Brysbaert et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-018-1077-9)) such that ≥90% of people knew each word.\n\n2. to be nouns, according to dominant part of speech in SUBTLEX-UK ([van Heuven et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.850521)).\n\n3. to have a mean concreteness rating >4 (on a 1-5 scale; [Brysbaert et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5))\n\n<br>\n\nPicture-Congruent and -Incongruent words were matched on:\n\n1. Word length (number of characters), exactly.\n\n2. Concreteness according to [Brysbaert et al. (2014)](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5), within ±.25\n\n3. Zipf frequency (a logarithmic scale of word frequency) according to SUBTLEX-UK ([van Heuven et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2013.850521)), within ±.125\n\n4. Character bigram probability (calculated from SUBTLEX-UK), within ±.0025\n\n5. OLD20 (the average Orthographic Levenshtein Distance of the 20 closest neighbours to a given word; [Yarkoni et al., 2008](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.3758/PBR.15.5.971)) calculated from the LexOPS inbuilt dataset, within ±.75.\n\n<br>\n\nMatched pairs of Picture-Congruent and -Incongruent words also had:\n\n1. Maximal distance from one another in orthographic Levenshtein distance.\n\n2. A cosine PPMI semantic similarity value of ≤.01 according to the Small World of Words ([De Deyne et al., 2019](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.3758/s13428-018-1115-7))\n\n<br>\n\nEach participant saw *Set 1* or *Set 2* of the stimuli, which determined which images preceded congruent, and which incongruent, words. These counterbalanced sets of stimuli were matched via overlap ([Pastore & Calcagnì, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01089)), to maximise distributional similarity in:\n\n1. Percentage of modal name agreement according to the BOSS norms\n\n2. Cosine PPMI semantic similarity according to the SWOW\n\n3. Zipf word frequency according to SUBTLEX-UK\n\n4. Character bigram probability according to SUBTLEX-UK\n\n5. Word concreteness ([Brysbaert et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-013-0403-5))\n\n6. Word length\n\n7. OLD20 (Orthographic neighbourhood density)\n\n![Picture-Word Stimuli Summary](img/stimuli_summary.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## Localiser Stimuli\n\n![](img/example_localiser_images.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nLocaliser stimuli comprised matched triplets of words (Courier New font), false-font strings (BACS2serif font; [Vidal et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-016-0844-8)), and phase-shuffled words. The pre-registered comparison was between words and false-font strings; phase-shuffled words were included as an exploratory comparison.\n\nDistributional similarity of the words to various variables was maximised via distributional overlap ([Pastore & Calcagnì, 2019](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01089)), as shown below.\n\n![](img/localiser_stimuli_summary.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nPhase-shuffled words were generated by randomly permuting the phase distribution of images of words.
